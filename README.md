Special Thanks
HMA Discord for the support!;)

## Notes ---

Only apply the patch on a CLEAN 1.0 FIRE RED ROM

This base contains 2 versions, the Vanilla and Hubol version(WARNING only the hubol version is on V1)

If you want to use HUBOL(the CFRU compilation built in on
Hex Maniac Advance), use the HUBOL version, If you aren't using Hubol, you have to use the Vanilla version.

If you want to use this base for a Kanto Game, you should know that the Blocks are NOT the same as the original Fire Red, so you will have to redrawn almost all maps.(only pallet town was redrawn for the base, and the scripts weren't ajusted to the new look of the map)

There's a NPC in Pallet Town that gives you all bagdes, all HMS, the Old Rod, the Bike, the VsSeeker,
a Machamp, a Gyarados, a Rattata and a Pidgey so you can test stuff.
